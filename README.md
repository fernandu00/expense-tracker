# Expense Tracker Project

This is a simple expense tracker app built using ReactJs. In the app user can be able to input transactions and the amount of money of every transaction in order to get a list of expenses and income with different style each, a total income and total expense indicator and the balance. The app persists user's data using localStorage in order to make the app usable even though there is no back-end application or database.

The user can also delete the transactions by clicking on them and the income, expense and total balance will recalculate.

## How it works

The app has one transaction list where all the entries are stored in a single state but in order to get income and expenses the app iterates over the transaction list to summ the amounts of positive and negative transactions and stores the total income and total expenses in two separated states and finally set the balance based on the positive and negative totals
